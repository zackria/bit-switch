Description

Bit Switch provides fast, private, and reliable local control for legacy WeMo devices — no cloud required. Discover devices on your local network, control switches and dimmers, view energy usage from Insight plugs, receive motion sensor state, and provision Wi‑Fi securely using AES-encrypted credentials for device setup.

Full device support: switches, dimmers, light switches, Insight energy plugs, motion sensors, outdoor plugs, Maker devices, and bridges.
Robust discovery: SSDP/UPnP discovery with M‑SEARCH reliable on-network detection.
Secure provisioning: built-in Wi‑Fi setup with AES-128-CBC password encryption to keep credentials private during device configuration.
Reliable control: improved GetBinaryState / SetBinaryState handling with clear status and error reporting.
Usability: streamlined Wi‑Fi setup dialog, password visibility toggle, and status indicators for connection and handshake.
Appearance: supports dark mode and refined themes for a modern, readable UI.

Why Bit Switch

Local-first: device discovery and control happen on your network — no cloud required or used for device control.
Privacy-focused: provisioning uses AES encryption; credentials are never sent to external services.
Practical: works with a wide range of legacy Belkin WeMo hardware still in the wild.

Compatibility & Privacy

Devices and phone must be on the same Wi‑Fi network.

Wi‑Fi scanning requires location permission; permissions are requested at runtime and used only for scanning and provisioning.
No cloud account required; local network control only. See our privacy policy on the support site for details.
