App name *: Bit Switch 

Short description *: Local control for legacy WeMo  discover, toggle, and provision Wi‑Fi.

Full description *: 

Bit Switch Local-first Wemo control — no cloud required for discovery and control.
Full device support: switches, dimmers, light switches, Insight plugs (energy), motion sensors, outdoor plugs, Maker, and bridge.
Built-in Wi‑Fi provisioning: scan networks, AES-encrypt password for device setup.

What's New / Improvements

Device discovery made robust via SSDP/UPnP (M‑SEARCH → setup.xml parsing) for reliable on‑network detection.
Improved Wi‑Fi provisioning flow with AES-128-CBC password encryption (see Wemo crypto implementation).
UI improvements: clearer Wi‑Fi setup dialog, error messages, password visibility toggle, and status indicators for connection/handshake.
Better state handling and error reporting when controlling devices (GetBinaryState / SetBinaryState SOAP calls).
Dark mode and theme refinements.

Compatibility & Requirements

Device and phone must be on the same Wi‑Fi network.
Router must allow UDP multicast for SSDP discovery.
Android SDK: runs on devices API 24+; tested up to target SDK 36.
Wi‑Fi scanning requires location permissions (user must grant at runtime).
